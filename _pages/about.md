I am currently a PhD Candidate at Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](https://sutd.edu.sg)) under the supervision of [Prof. Dorien Herremans](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/faculty/dorien-herremans/).

My research focused on deep learning-based audio processing technolgies. You can find my publications [here](/publications).

I also enjoy making useful [libraries](/portfolio) that improve research productivity.
